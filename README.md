ReadMe Test

I wasnt sure how you guys wanted it submitted. I have included 3 different .bas files. 

File 1 - Allows the script to run on one partifular sheet
File 2 - Is an add-on to the first file that will allow it to run on all sheets in a workbook, but needs to be placed in the same module.
File 1+2 - Combines both of the above and will run given you run the second subroutine.

Combining the two into a single subroutine was definitely possible and can be submited upon request, but as per what one student was told by the TA, that was not wanted/needed.

If you would like that file, please let me know and I will be happy to submit it as well.

The instructions were a little vague in some regards so I hope that I have completed it satisfactorily. I also included the data with the VBS code embedded complete with buttons.
